This project makes extensive use of Machine Learning to detect the people wandering without mask or not following social distancing - in order to spread awareness about the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It feeds data to realtime database - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and then the data is fetched and displayed onto the [website](https://prajesheleven.github.io/innohacks-db/).
